# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Project Overview 
 Customer Churning is a major concern for any industry or sector., no company wants that their user stops using their services. In this project, I focused on Bank Customers, and I used machine learning algorithms to predict either the customers exit the bank or continue to use their services. The project will help the bank by identifying the potential customers who may leave the bank. The bank can provide attractive offers to them or ask them for feedback. And If they are facing some difficulty with bank services, it can be resolved early, and we can retain the customers.

## Data
The dataset is taken from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers). The dataset has 10,000 records total, and it is a binary classification dataset (either customer will exit from the bank or not). There are 7963 records for customers who do no exit from the bank and 2037 records for the customer who exit from the bank. The features of the dataset are as follows:
