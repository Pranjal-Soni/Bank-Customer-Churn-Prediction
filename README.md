# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Project Overview 
 Customer Churning is major concern for any industry or sector. No company wants that their user stop using their seriveces. In this project I focuesd on Bank Customers, and I used machine learning algorithms to predict either the customer exit the bank or he will continue to user their. The project will help the bank by identifying the pontential customers, who may leave the bank. The bank can attrective offer to them or ask them for feedback. And If they are facing some difficulty with bank servieces, it can be resolved at early time and we can retain the customers.
